Java Enterprise project with registration/authorization and role-based access rights (user, admin). Admin can create / edit / delete users, user can manage his profile and data (date, food, calories) through UI (AJAX) and REST interface with basic authorization. A data filtration by date and time is available, the color of the table entry depends on the sum of calories per day (an editable parameter in user profile). The whole REST interface is covered by JUnit tests using Spring MVC Test and Spring Security Test.
